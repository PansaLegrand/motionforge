/**
 * Timeline choreography: sequences presets across multiple nodes without
 * hand-computed frame offsets. Pure — compiles to the same keyframe arrays
 * presets already emit, on each node's local clock.
 *
 * The frame math is the part humans and LLMs get wrong (change one duration
 * and every downstream offset is silently stale), so the timeline owns it:
 * entries default to starting when the previous entry ends, `after` targets
 * an earlier entry by node id, `overlap`/`gap` nudge from there, and
 * `stagger` spaces a group N frames apart.
 *
 * Offsets are applied by shifting keyframes with a hold of the first value
 * from frame 0 — an entrance preset's held `opacity: 0` keeps the node
 * invisible until its slot arrives. All choreographed nodes are assumed to
 * share a start (`from`), since keyframes run on each node's local clock.
