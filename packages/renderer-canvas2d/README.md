# @motionforge/renderer-canvas2d

Deterministic Canvas2D still-frame renderer for [motionforge](https://github.com/PansaLegrand/motionforge) scenes. The same renderer drives preview and export, so what you scrub is what you ship.

## Install

```sh
npm install @motionforge/renderer-canvas2d
```

## Usage

```ts
import { renderStill, resolveAssets } from "@motionforge/renderer-canvas2d";

const canvas = document.createElement("canvas");
canvas.width = scene.width;
canvas.height = scene.height;

// Asset loading is the only async phase: fetch + decode once per scene.
const assets = await resolveAssets(scene);

const context = canvas.getContext("2d");
renderStill(context, scene, /* frame */ 30, { assets });
```

Works with both `CanvasRenderingContext2D` and `OffscreenCanvasRenderingContext2D`.

Rendering is pure given `(scene, frame, assets)`: the same inputs always produce the same pixels. Scenes that draw `img` nodes throw an actionable error if assets were not resolved — a frame never renders with silently missing media. `img` nodes honor `objectFit` (`fill`, `contain`, `cover`, `none`, `scale-down`), `objectPosition`, and `borderRadius` clipping.

Font assets load through the same call and register under their asset id: declare `{ id: "Inter-Bold", type: "font", src: "..." }` and style text with `fontFamily: "Inter-Bold"`. Embed fonts whenever pixel-exact text matters; unregistered families fall back through the canvas font stack.

## API Stability

Stable for 0.x integrations:

- `resolveAssets(scene)`, `prepareFrame(scene, frame, assets)`, `renderStill(context, scene, frame, options)`, and `disposeAssets(assets)`.
- `RenderOptions` and `ResolvedAssets` as the handoff shape between preview, export, and custom render loops.
- `videoSourceTime()` and `lottieSourceFrame()` for tools that need to mirror source-time labels.

Experimental before 1.0:

- Concrete decoded clip shapes (`VideoClip`, `AudioClip`, `LottieClip`, `PreparedVideoFrame`) are exposed so advanced integrations can share resolved assets, but their internals may change with streaming or pooling work.
- `validateLottieDocument()` is public for preflight tools, but the rejection rules may tighten as Lottie support expands.

Internal/not public:

- Asset resolver internals, mediabunny sinks, and lottie-web player objects should not be manipulated directly unless you own the full render pipeline.
- Files outside the package root export are implementation details.
