# Changelog

All publishable packages (`@motionforge/schema`, `@motionforge/core`, `@motionforge/renderer-canvas2d`, `@motionforge/export`, `@motionforge/presets`, `@motionforge/player`) version together.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-06-11

The agent-loop and playback release: scenes are now editable by patch, playable in real time with sound, and can carry Lottie vector animations.

### @motionforge/schema

- **Scene patch ops (RFC 0001)**: `applyScenePatch(scene, patch)` applies id-addressed, transactional edits — `setStyle` (merge, null deletes), `setText`, `retime`, `setAnimations`, `insertNode`/`removeNode`/`moveNode`, `setAsset`/`removeAsset` (guarded by references), `setSceneMeta`. Pure: a failing op rejects the whole patch and never mutates the input; misspelled ids get closest-match suggestions. `scenePatchSchema`/`sceneOpSchema` exported.
- New style properties: `filter` (validated brightness/contrast/saturate/grayscale/sepia/invert/opacity/hue-rotate/blur chains), `zIndex`, `border`, `boxShadow`.
- New node/asset type `lottie`; `volume` now validates on video nodes; `playbackRate` on video and lottie nodes.

### @motionforge/player (new package)

- Real-time playback: deterministic `FrameClock` (wall-clock time exists only here), play/pause/seek/loop, latest-frame-wins decode policy, `frame`/`play`/`pause`/`ended` events.
- Audio preview: scenes with audible nodes play sound via one cached buffer mixed by the exact export functions; audio is the master clock (frame clock re-anchors on drift). Injectable `AudioPreview`/`now`/scheduler keep everything unit-testable.

### @motionforge/renderer-canvas2d

- `filter` chains (Canvas2D `context.filter`), `zIndex` sibling paint order, `border` strokes, `boxShadow` on background fills.
- **Lottie nodes**: self-contained vector Lottie documents render frame-exactly (clamped seek, per-node staging, `objectFit`). Documents with JS expressions or external images are rejected — determinism contract. lottie-web is an optional peer dependency, loaded only when a scene uses it.
- Video clips expose their own audio track (`VideoClip.audio`).

### @motionforge/export

- Video nodes contribute their clip soundtrack to the export at `volume`, trimmed with the picture; `playbackRate` retimes audio varispeed-style.
- Audio mixes in fixed windows (`audioChunkSeconds`, default 10 s) — flat memory at any scene length. `mixSceneAudio`, `audioChunkRanges` exported.
- Benchmarked: 1080p two-decoder export beats realtime (see `docs/benchmarks.md`).

### @motionforge/presets

- **`timeline()` choreography**: `.add(id, preset, { at | after | overlap | gap })`, `.stagger(ids, preset, { every })`, `.compile()` per-node keyframes or `.compileToPatch()` ready-to-apply patch ops. Frame-0 holds keep entrances hidden until their slot.

### Tooling and docs

- Playground: agent console (paste a scene or patch, applied via the public APIs, agent-grade errors), six showcase scenes including audio and Lottie demos.
- Golden harness: committed baseline PNGs with received/diff artifacts on mismatch; 1080p benchmark; Playwright E2E (`pnpm e2e`); determinism lint (`scripts/check-determinism.mjs`).
- `tools/agent-eval`: mechanical LLM eval harness for scene generation/editing.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-06-11

Animation maturity release. This is the publish target for the first public launch, skipping the unpublished 0.1.0 package set.

### @motionforge/schema

- Easing expressions are now part of the scene contract: named easings plus `cubic-bezier(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, `spring`, and `spring(bounce)`.
- Validation rejects malformed easing expressions with actionable messages while keeping existing scenes compatible.

### @motionforge/core

- `transform` keyframes now interpolate numerically for matching `translate(...)`, `scale(...)`, and `rotate(...)` function lists and compatible units.
- Mismatched transform lists or unit conflicts keep deterministic step behavior, matching the documented fallback.
- Added deterministic cubic-bezier and spring easing evaluators used by numeric, color, and transform interpolation.

### @motionforge/presets

- New package: pure animation presets and caption generators that compile to scene data.
- Motion presets: `popIn`, `fadeUp`, `slideIn(direction)`, and `pulse`.
- Caption generators: `tiktokCaptions()` for one-word-at-a-time captions with highlight pills and `karaokeCaptions()` for whole-line karaoke captions with active-word color ramps.
- Added a generator example proving the TikTok caption scene can be regenerated from one preset call.

### Docs and Examples

- Added the weeks 3–4 roadmap for animation maturity, launch, and the editor readiness.
- Added/updated TikTok caption examples, generated frames, and agent-facing docs so agents prefer presets over hand-authored animation JSON.

Verified by 80 unit tests, 15 golden fixtures, 11 in-browser integration checks, and the generated TikTok caption scene rendered end to end.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-06-11

First release. A deterministic, browser-native video scene engine: the canonical video is a JSON scene document, and preview and export share the same Canvas2D renderer.

### @motionforge/schema

- Zod scene schema for `schemaVersion: 0`: frame-based timing, a curated CSS-like style subset, keyframe animations, and an asset map.
- `parseScene` / `validateScene` with actionable, path-qualified error messages; cross-field invariants (unique node ids, asset key = asset id, per-node-type requirements, strictly increasing keyframes).
- Parse-once semantics: re-parsing an already-parsed scene is an identity no-op, so frame loops never re-validate.
- `sceneJsonSchema()` plus a shipped `scene.schema.json` (draft-07) for validating scenes without executing code.

### @motionforge/core

- Builder API (`composition`, `div`, `text`, `img`, `video`) with deterministic auto ids, serializing to the exact scene format.
- `evaluateScene(scene, frame)`: pure keyframe evaluation — numeric interpolation with easing, color interpolation in RGBA space (`parseColor` exported), string stepping.
- `layoutScene`: absolute and flex layout implementing every validated layout property (insets, margin, min/max clamps, padding, gap, `justify-content` including `space-between`, `align-items` including `stretch`).

### @motionforge/renderer-canvas2d

- `renderStill(ctx, scene, frame, { assets })`: deterministic still-frame rendering for window and offscreen canvases.
- `resolveAssets(scene)`: the engine's only async phase — decodes image assets (SVG included) and registers font assets under their asset id. Missing media fails loudly, never silently.
- Multi-line text with measured word wrap, `lineHeight`, `letterSpacing`, `fontStyle`; images with the full `objectFit` set and `objectPosition`; `linear-gradient` with arbitrary stops and angles; `overflow: "hidden"` clipping that follows `borderRadius`; transforms with `transformOrigin`.

### @motionforge/export

- `exportVideo({ scene })`: in-browser MP4 export via WebCodecs, encoded and muxed by mediabunny, with codec negotiation (AVC → VP9/AV1 fallback), sub-range export, abort, progress, and bitrate control.
- `renderFrameSequence`: the deterministic frame loop with microsecond timestamps that `exportVideo` is built on.
- `detectExportCapability()` for gating UI.

Verified by 51 unit tests and 14 pixel-exact/probed golden fixtures plus an MP4 export smoke test, all hashed against a Playwright-pinned Chromium.
