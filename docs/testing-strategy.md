# Testing Strategy

Testing is part of the design, not a cleanup phase. Each engine slice should land with the smallest useful test that proves the behavior and makes future renderer work safer.

## Current Test Layers

- `pnpm typecheck`: strict TypeScript across every workspace package.
- `pnpm test`: Vitest unit tests for schema, core, renderer, presets, authoring, player, export helpers, chat, and app utilities.
- `pnpm build`: package builds plus app production builds where packages define them.
- `pnpm golden:test`: Playwright-pinned Chromium renders fixture scenes, checks golden-frame hashes/probes, runs browser MP4 export smoke, and decodes exported video/audio for media assertions.
- `pnpm e2e`: launches the real playground, verifies canvas paint, playback controls, patch validation/application, audio scene playback, Lottie playback, and console cleanliness.

## Release Gates

- `pnpm release:fast`: run before merging core changes. It runs typecheck, unit tests, determinism lint, builds, and built CLI/create-project smokes.
- `pnpm release:full`: run before tagging or publishing. It runs the fast gate plus long-scene resource smoke, browser goldens, playground E2E, and `npm pack --dry-run` for every publishable package.
- `pnpm verify:clean`: pack publishable packages, install a generated starter in a temp directory, and run the starter's `validate`, `inspect`, and `build` scripts outside the monorepo.

The gate script lives at `scripts/release-gate.mjs`; clean-machine verification lives at `scripts/verify-clean-machine.mjs`. When a command fails, the scripts print the exact command and let the underlying tool output stay visible.

## RC Golden Matrix

`pnpm golden:test` is the release-candidate browser media gate. It runs `tools/golden/src/cli.ts` against `tools/golden/src/harness.ts` and the fixtures in `tools/golden/src/fixtures.ts`.

## Golden Artifacts

Exact hash fixtures store both JSON snapshots and PNG baselines under `fixtures/goldens`.

- Update accepted visual changes with `pnpm golden:update`.
- Inspect any mismatch before updating; hash failures write `expected`, `received`, and `diff` PNGs under `fixtures/goldens/__diffs__`.
- Probe fixtures intentionally avoid pixel-perfect hashes when text shaping is platform-sensitive but still assert visible/absent pixels.
- Browser media checks synthesize their own video and audio assets inside the harness, so they do not need large binary fixtures.

## Slice Rules

- Schema changes need valid and invalid examples.
- Layout changes need at least one geometric assertion.
- Animation changes need deterministic numeric assertions.
- Renderer changes need either a unit-level contract test or a golden/probe fixture.
- Export changes need capability/failure-path tests plus a browser encode/decode assertion when the behavior depends on WebCodecs, media decoding, muxing, or AAC output.
- Preset and authoring helpers should test emitted scene data, then rely on golden/showcase coverage for renderer-visible behavior.
- App/editor behavior should get a focused unit test for pure planning logic and a Playwright smoke only when the browser workflow is the product contract.

## Near-Term Gaps

- Ducking is still future mixer work; when it ships, add both unit windows and browser RMS checks before marking AX5 complete.
- Long-scene preview audio still uses a whole-scene Web Audio buffer. Export is chunked; preview can move to a chunked/custom `AudioPreview` backend when real long-editor workloads require it.
- Clean-machine package verification is not yet automated outside the monorepo.
- `pnpm verify:clean -- --keep` preserves the temp starter for manual Studio/browser-export checks.
